# 615-final-project

How companies describe the jobs they are trying to fill is a good way to find the words to describe your skills and experience.  There are many job boards that are accessible online -- see Job Board API's.   Is the vocabulary used to describe jobs for data scientists and statisticians consisent between job boards?  Are there words that are specific to subfields or geogoraphic areas?  Are there words that are associated with salary levels?   Can you produce a list of descriptors that are commonly used?  

I use job information form the job board website “cybercoders.com” from the sections like “What You Need for this Position” and for other job boards, I also use Github jobs to compare.

Note: report 3 is the final version report.
